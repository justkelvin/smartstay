Welcome to the backend API for **SmartStay**, a comprehensive hotel booking system built with Spring Boot. This API provides functionalities for users to search, book, review hotels, and for administrators to manage the platform's data.

## üåü Key Features

*   ‚úÖ **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Role-based access control (CUSTOMER, ADMIN).
*   ‚úÖ **Hotel Management:** CRUD operations for hotels, including details like amenities, star rating, check-in/out times.
*   ‚úÖ **Room Management:** Manage rooms within hotels, linking them to specific types and managing availability status.
*   ‚úÖ **Room Type Definitions:** Define different room types (Standard, Deluxe, Suite, etc.) with base pricing and capacity.
*   ‚úÖ **Availability Search:** Find available rooms across hotels based on dates, location, capacity, and room type.
*   ‚úÖ **Booking System:** Create, view, and cancel bookings. Admin management of booking statuses.
*   ‚úÖ **Payment Processing (Simulated):** Handle payment information linked to bookings, including simulated processing and refunds.
*   ‚úÖ **Review System:** Allow users to submit reviews for completed stays. Admin approval and response capabilities.
*   ‚úÖ **User Profile Management:** Users can view and update their profile information.
*   ‚úÖ **Data Seeding:** Includes a `DataLoader` (active in `dev` profile) to populate the database with sample data for development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 17 or later.
*   **Maven:** Build tool (usually comes with IDEs or install separately).
*   **Git:** Version control system.
*   **(Optional) Database Client:** Like DBeaver, pgAdmin, etc., if you want to inspect the database.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd hotel-booking
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    This will download dependencies and compile the code.
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

The application uses Spring Profiles to manage configurations. The `dev` profile is configured by default in `application.properties` to enable the `DataLoader` and use the H2 in-memory database.

1.  **Run using Maven:**
    ```bash
    # This command explicitly activates the 'dev' profile
    mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
    ```
    *(Alternatively, if `dev` is set as default in `application.properties`, `mvn spring-boot:run` might suffice)*

2.  **Accessing the Application:**
    *   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080` (or the port configured in `application.properties`).
    *   The H2 database console (when using the `dev` or `test` profile) is available at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`.
        *   **JDBC URL:** `jdbc:h2:mem:smartstaydb` (for dev) or `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb` (for test)
        *   **Username:** `sa`
        *   **Password:** (leave blank)

## üó∫Ô∏è API Endpoints Overview

The API follows RESTful conventions. The base path for most endpoints is `/api`.

*   `/api/auth/` - Authentication (Login, Register)
*   `/api/hotels/` - Hotel information and search
*   `/api/rooms/` - Room details and availability search
*   `/api/bookings/` - Booking creation and management
*   `/api/payments/` - Payment processing and information
*   `/api/reviews/` - Review submission and retrieval
*   `/api/users/` - User profile management

*Note: For detailed API documentation, consider integrating Swagger/OpenAPI in the future.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Key configuration settings are located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

*   **Server Port:** `server.port` (default: 8080)
*   **Database:** `spring.datasource.*` properties configure the database connection. H2 is used by default for `dev` and `test` profiles. PostgreSQL settings are commented out for reference.
    *   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop` is used for H2. **DO NOT** use this in production. Use `validate` or `none` and manage schema changes with migration tools like Flyway or Liquibase for production databases.
*   **JWT:**
    *   `app.jwt.secret`: The secret key for signing JWTs. **This should be externalized and kept secure in production!**
    *   `app.jwt.expiration-ms`: Token validity duration (default: 24 hours).
*   **Profiles:** `spring.profiles.active` determines the active profile(s). `dev` enables the `DataLoader`.

---

## üîí Security

*   Authentication is handled via JWT. Users obtain a token upon successful login (`/api/auth/login`).
*   The JWT must be included in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests to protected endpoints (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>`).
*   Endpoints are secured based on roles (CUSTOMER, ADMIN) using Spring Security annotations (`@PreAuthorize`) and configuration in `SecurityConfig.java`.
*   Passwords are securely hashed using `BCryptPasswordEncoder`.
*   CORS is configured in `CorsConfig.java` to allow requests from typical frontend development ports (localhost:3000, 8081, 4200). Adjust as needed.

---

## üß™ Testing

The project includes unit and integration tests.

*   **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```
*   Tests use the `test` profile (`src/test/resources/application-test.properties`), which configures a separate H2 in-memory database (`jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`).
*   **Current Coverage:** Basic tests for `UserService` and `AuthController` are provided. **More tests are needed** to cover services, controllers, and business logic thoroughly.
